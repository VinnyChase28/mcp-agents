## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Restart Claude Desktop** after configuring your MCP servers
2. **Look for the tool icon** üî® indicating MCP servers are connected
3. **Start with simple prompts** like basic calculations or file reading
4. **Try combinations** of different server capabilities
5. **Explore real-world scenarios** that match your workflow

## üí° Tips for Better Results

- Be specific about file paths (use absolute paths when needed)
- Include context about what you're trying to accomplish
- Ask Claude to explain what it's doing with each tool
- Combine operations for more complex workflows
- Use error handling prompts to understand limitations

Remember: Claude will use your MCP servers automatically when you ask for operations they can handle!
